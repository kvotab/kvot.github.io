The Incas used bismuth (along with the usual copper and tin) in a special bronze alloy for knives.[34] Agricola(1546) states that bismuth is a distinct metal in a family of metals including tin and lead. This was based on observation of the metals and their physical properties.[35] Miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth the name tectum argenti, or ""silver being made"" in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed within the Earth.[36][37][38]Beginning with Johann Heinrich Pott in 1738,[39] Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and Torbern Olof Bergman, the distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear, and Claude François Geoffroy demonstrated in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead and tin.[37][40][41]"
